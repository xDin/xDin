# 👋🏼 Hello! I'm Diego
💻 Final-year Computer Systems Engineering student  
⚙️ Building and maintaining a full work-order & quoting system for my residency  
🧪 Unreasonable love for engineering and using web dev to solve real problems  
🌵 Mexican from Sonora, aiming to work abroad soon

# 🚀 Projects
### OT System - Full Work-Order & Quoting Platform *(ongoing project, used in a real small business)*
End-to-end platform for managing work orders, customers, quoting, file uploads, analytics, and automated notifications.  
Built with Next.js, TypeScript, Prisma, PostgreSQL, and Vercel.  
Used daily in a small **windows, glass, and shades business** (residential and commercial).  
Originally developed for my professional residency and maintained with occasional updates as the business needs grow.
